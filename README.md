# Probability-Puzzles

## Goal of this notebook
> To critically examine several popular probability puzzles and gain a deeper understanding of the logic behind them

## Puzzles:
### 1. Monty Hall Problem
> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
<br> <br> Contestants who switch have a 2/3
chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to their initial choice have only a 1/3 chance.

### 2. The Birthday Problem 
> Despite the fact that there are 365 days in a year, if you survey a random group of just 23 people there is a 50% chance that two of them will have the same birthday. <br><br> This exercise shows the compounding power of exponents, and how unintuitive they are to most people.
